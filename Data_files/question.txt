Dear Candidate,

 

Please find below test case.

SQL Exercise – Use any SQL engine of your choice unless specified below.

 
Question 1 - Gaps & Islands
    
    Use attached file.
    Country, Category & Dat should be unique. If not, drop lower value.
    
    Exercise 1: Identify gaps – Fill with 0.
    
    Exercise 2:
    Identify islands - continuous dates with same value – e.g. 2001-01-01 & 2021-01-02 & 2021-01-03 have value = 3 – Compact data by creating start & end date. In this case Start = 2021-01-01 & End = 2023-01-03.
    
    Exercise 3:
    Create column with a percentage share of value across sum by country
    
    Note: Provide SQL code.


 


Combinations
For n = 2, k =2 result would be

1,1

1,2

2,2

Note 2,1 is eliminated size 1,2 already uses same elements.

Repetition of element inside set is allowed. Elimination rule – Lower value wins – Ordered from left to right. E.g. 1,3,2 wins over 2,3,1.

 

Generate table using SQL for k=7 and n =7

Provide your SQL code and total size of table (row count)
